- each field equal number 1 to 9 (better use f1-f9)
- when player make a move - add his decision (variable) to his object
- after each move check object for having any winning 
combination of variables (example: f1, f2, f3 or f1, f5, f9) - 8 combos !
- aslo check if other player's object already have 
same value - if so - don't allow this move
- the other way is eliminate variable from game array after each move and next move check if it's hasn't that variable - block a move.
- if there is winning combination - finish the game and congrats the winner
- if no variables left in game array and there are no winning combination - tie, start again

- only after working console version - make HTML and CSS to interract with real user.
